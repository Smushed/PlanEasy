## **About This App**

Welcome to PlanEasy! This app allows users to sign in and connect with others by recording and comparing freetime between them. Please see the demo credentials above to give the app a try!
<br />
<br />
This is a single page web application that was originally for the first project of the Northwestern Full Stack Coding Bootcamp August Cohort.

## Future Developments

In development is moving this application from a single page web app to an app utilizing the full MERN stack. Please see below for the current known issues and goals of the project. 
<br />
<br />
Currently all users connect with each other, there is no way to specificy who you would like to share your freetime with. Adding friends is going to be a key component of this moving forward.

<br />
Additionally, this app currently only searches for data in Chicago rather than where the user is located. While we currently have the capibility to do this with taking the user's ZIP on account creation, to get the weather for the event time proves difficult.
